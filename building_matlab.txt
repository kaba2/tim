Building TIM Matlab
===================

[[Parent]]: building.txt

This page describes how to build the TIM Matlab interface. This is only
necessary if prebuilt binaries are not available for your platform 
at the [main page][Main]. To be able to build the TIM Matlab interface, 
you need to first [build the TIM libraries][Core].

Build process
-------------

Matlab uses special kinds of shared libraries to extend it. These
are called _mex files_. The building process for such files must be 
driven from Matlab, because this is the only way that the approriate
libraries will get linked into the resulting mex library, no matter
what the Matlab version. Matlab redirects the compilation and linking
to an external compiler, such as Visual Studio or gcc. 

### 1. Select a compiler

To select the compiler Matlab uses, type

	mex -setup
	
on the Matlab command line, and follow the instructions. 
A compiler can be used to build the TIM Matlab interface if
 
 * The compiler is supported by Matlab, meaning also that the
   compiler has been used to build the Matlab external interface
   libraries (i.e. it is not ok to change the used gcc version 
   manually). The main point here is that the used C++ standard 
   libraries must match across all libraries.
 
 * The same compiler is used to build the TIM Core and TIM Matlab 
 libraries.
 
 * The architectures of the libraries match: 
 32-bit libraries against 32-bit libraries,
 and 64-bit libraries against 64-bit libraries.
 
The current list of supported compilers for Matlab 2010b can be 
found [from here][MatlabSupported]. There is a similar list for
the previous versions.

__Note__: since OpenMP was introduced in gcc 4.2, and the supported
compiler for Mac OS X is only of version 4.0, it is not currently 
possible to build TIM in Mac OS X with OpenMP enabled.

__Note__: Matlab 32-bit is required to build 32-bit mex files, and
Matlab 64-bit is required to build 64-bit mex files. In particular, it 
is not possible to do 32-bit builds from Matlab 64-bit.

### 2. Set the external library directories

In `tim` root-directory, open the file `build_tim.m`,
which will at some point read something like this:

	timIncludePath = '.';
	pastelIncludePath = '..\pastel';
	boostIncludePath = '..\external\boost_1_51_0';

	timLibraryPath = ['build\vs2010\lib\', mode];
	pastelLibraryPath = ['..\pastel\build\vs2010\lib\', mode];

Replace the directories to reflect the locations of the libraries.

### 3. Add some flags and libraries

To enable OpenMP (support for multiple cores), do the following:

* Add the OpenMP flag to the compiler flags.
Since Matlab does not have a compiler-independent option for this,
you must manually modify the Matlab options file for your compiler. 
Consult the Matlab documentation on how to do this. 
On gcc the flag is `-fopenmp`, while for Visual Studio the flag is `/openmp`.

* On Linux, add the `-lgomp` option in `build_tim.m` to include the OpenMP 
library.

On the 64-bit Linux, if you want to build the 32-bit version (requires 
Matlab 32-bit), add the `-m32` compiler flag in the g++ flags of the 
`glnx86` section in the options file.

### 4. Choose configuration and build

To build TIM Matlab in release mode, type in Matlab command line:

	>> build_tim

Alternatively, you can build the TIM Matlab interface in other
modes by running the script with the desired configuration, e.g.

	>> build_tim('debug')

You can get additional help by

	>> help build_tim

Output files
------------

The only output file from this process is the `tim_matlab` mex file.
The extension of this file depends on your operating system and whether
your Matlab is 32-bit or 64-bit. They extensions are

 * .mexglx for 32-bit Linux (or Mac), 
 * .mexa64 for 64-bit Linux (or Mac), 
 * .mexw32 for 32-bit Windows, and 
 * .mexw64 for 64-bit Windows.
