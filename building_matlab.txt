Building TIM Matlab
===================

[[Parent]]: tim.txt

This page describes how to build TIM Matlab. This is only
necessary if prebuilt binaries are not available for your platform 
at the [main page][Main]. To be able to build TIM Matlab, you
need to first [build the TIM libraries][Core].

Build process
-------------

Matlab uses special kinds of shared libraries to extend it. These
are called _mex files_. The building process for such files must be 
driven from Matlab, because this is the only way that the approriate
libraries will get linked into the resulting mex library, no matter
what the Matlab version. Matlab redirects the compilation and linking
to an external compiler, such as Visual Studio or gcc. 

### 1. Select a compiler

To be able to build TIM Matlab on your compiler, the used Matlab version 
must support the compiler. For example, support for Visual Studio 2010 
was added in Matlab 2010b. To select the compiler Matlab uses, type

	mex -setup
	
on the Matlab command line, and follow the instructions. The compiler 
you select must be the same you used to build TIM Core. 

### 2. Set the external library directories

In `tim/matlab` directory, open the file `build_options.txt`,
which will read something like this:

	tim_matlab.cpp
	-D_HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING=0 
	-DPASTEL_ENABLE_OMP
	-I'../../../pastel' 
	-I'../../../tim'
	-I'../../../../external/boost_1_45_0'
	-L'../../../pastel/build/vs2008/lib'
	-L'../../../tim/build/vs2008/lib'
	-lPastelSys
	-lPastelMatlab
	-lPastelMath
	-lPastelGeometry
	-lTimCore
	-lTimMatlab
	
Replace the directories to reflect the locations of the libraries.
The `I` is for an include directory, while `L` is for a library
directory. For debug mode, there is a similar option file
`build_options_debug.txt`.

### 3. Choose configuration and build

To build TIM Matlab in release mode, type in Matlab command line:

	>> build_tim
	
To build TIM Matlab in debug mode, type in Matlab command line:

	>> build_tim_debug

Output files
------------

The only output file from this process is the `tim_matlab` mex file.
