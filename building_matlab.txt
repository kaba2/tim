Building TIM Matlab
===================

[[Parent]]: building.txt

This page describes how to build the TIM Matlab interface.

Build process
-------------

### Build TIM libraries

[Build the TIM libraries][Core].

[Core]: [[Ref]]: building.txt

### Select a compiler

To select the compiler Matlab uses, type

	mex -setup
	
on the Matlab command line, and follow the instructions. 
A compiler can be used to build the TIM Matlab interface if
 
 * The compiler is supported by Matlab, meaning also that the
   compiler has been used to build the Matlab external interface
   libraries (i.e. it is not ok to change the used gcc version 
   manually). The main point here is that the used C++ standard 
   libraries must match across all libraries.
 
 * The same compiler is used to build the TIM Core and TIM Matlab 
 libraries.
 
 * The architectures of the libraries match: 
 32-bit libraries against 32-bit libraries,
 and 64-bit libraries against 64-bit libraries.
 
The current list of supported compilers for Matlab 2013b can be 
found [from here][MatlabSupported]. There is a similar list for
the previous versions.

__Note__: Matlab 32-bit is required to build 32-bit mex files, and
Matlab 64-bit is required to build 64-bit mex files. In particular, it 
is not possible to do 32-bit builds from Matlab 64-bit.

### Set the external library directories

In `tim` root-directory, open the file `build_tim.m`,
which will at some point read something like this:

	pastelIncludePath = '../../pastel';
	boostIncludePath = '../../boost_1_53_0';
	tbbIncludePath = '../../tbb42/include';

	timLibraryPath = ['../lib/', mode];
	pastelLibraryPath = ['../../pastel/lib/', mode];
	tbbLibraryPath = ['../../tbb42/lib'];

Modify the paths to correspond to your directory structure.

### Add some flags

On the 64-bit Linux, if you want to build the 32-bit version (requires 
Matlab 32-bit), add the `-m32` compiler flag in the g++ flags of the 
`glnx86` section in the options file.

### Choose configuration and build

To build TIM Matlab in release mode, type in Matlab command line:

	build_tim

Alternatively, you can build the TIM Matlab interface in other
modes by running the script with the desired configuration, e.g.

	build_tim('debug')

You can get additional help by

	help build_tim

Output files
------------

The only output file from this process is the `tim_matlab` mex file.
The extension of this file depends on your operating system and whether
your Matlab is 32-bit or 64-bit. The extensions are

 * .mexglx for 32-bit Linux (or Mac), 
 * .mexa64 for 64-bit Linux (or Mac), 
 * .mexw32 for 32-bit Windows, and 
 * .mexw64 for 64-bit Windows.
