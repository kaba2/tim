TIM Matlab interface
====================

TIM Matlab can be downloaded from [TIM's main page][TIM]_.

There are two sides to the implementation of TIM Matlab:
the C++ implementation and the Matlab implementation.
The Matlab implementation consists mostly of redirection
functions that check the parameters at the Matlab's side,
and if they are correct, forward the calls to the C++
implementation via the tim_matlab mex file.
In the C++ implementation side, TIM Matlab mostly
consists of interpreting the data via correct
data abstractions so that they can be forwarded to the 
actual computation functions of TIM Core. As a user
of TIM Matlab, you only need to know about the Matlab
implementation.

General information
-------------------

### Naming

In the function names, the _t_ suffix stands for a temporal version,
while the _p_ suffix stands for a partialized version 
(partial mutual information and partial transfer entropy). 
Because partialization and temporality are orthogonal 
concepts, there are also versions which have both. These are 
named with the _pt_ suffix.

### Integrated help

You can find function-specific documentation by using 
Matlab's integrated help system. For example, for help on
using the differential_entropy_kl function: 
	
	>> help differential_entropy_kl
	  DIFFERENTIAL_ENTROPY_KL
	  A differential entropy estimate from samples
	  using Kozachenko-Leonenko nearest neighbor estimator.
	 
	  H = differential_entropy_kl(S, k, threads)
	 
	  where
	  ...
