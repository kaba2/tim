TIM Matlab
==========

[[Parent]]: tim.txt

_TIM Matlab_ is one of the three ways to access the 
functionality in TIM. It consists of a set of Matlab functions
together with a mex file implemented in C++.
The Matlab implementation consists mostly of redirection
functions that check the parameters at the Matlab's side,
and forward the calls to the C++ implementation via the 
tim_matlab mex file. 
The C++ implementation mostly consists of interpreting the 
data via correct data abstractions so that they can be 
forwarded to the actual computation functions of TIM Core. 
As a user of TIM Matlab, you only need to know about the 
Matlab implementation.

### Naming

In the function names, the _t_ suffix stands for a temporal version,
while the _p_ suffix stands for a partialized version 
(partial mutual information and partial transfer entropy). 
Because partialization and temporality are orthogonal 
concepts, there are also versions which have both. These are 
named with the _pt_ suffix.

### Integrated help

You can find function-specific documentation by using 
Matlab's integrated help system. For example, for help on
using the differential_entropy_kl function: 
	
	>> help differential_entropy_kl
	  DIFFERENTIAL_ENTROPY_KL
	  A differential entropy estimate from samples
	  using Kozachenko-Leonenko nearest neighbor estimator.
	 
	  H = differential_entropy_kl(S, k)
	 
	  where
	  ...
