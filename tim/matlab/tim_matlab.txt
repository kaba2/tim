TIM Matlab interface

Naming
------

In the function names, the 't' suffix stands for a temporal version, 
which is adaptive to temporal changes in the estimated measure
via time-windowing. The 'p' suffix stands for a partialized
version (partial mutual information and partial transfer entropy). 
Because partialization and temporality are orthogonal 
concepts, there are also versions which have both. These are 
named with the 'pt' suffix.
If you do not need temporal results, then you should use
the non-temporal versions: they are more efficient
in their memory use when using multiple threads 
(however, their performance is similar).

Integrated help
---------------

You can find function-specific documentation by using 
Matlab's integrated help system. For example, for help on
using the differential_entropy_kl function, enter 
'help differential_entropy_kl' in Matlab.
