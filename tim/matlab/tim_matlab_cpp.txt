TIM Matlab - C++ implementation
===============================

[[Parent]]: tim_matlab.txt

The C++ implementation of TIM Matlab exposes
to Matlab a single mex function called 
tim_matlab(). The first argument of this function 
specifies the name of the function that should be 
called inside the C++ implementation while the rest 
of the arguments are arguments for that function.

The TIM Matlab interface can be expanded easily by
implementing new C++ functions and registering them 
to be callable via tim_matlab. If you need to do
this, have a look at how the existing functions have
been implemented. In Matlab, calling 

	>> tim_matlab('list_functions');
	
lists all the registered functions.

The entry point to the tim_matlab mex file is located 
at tim_matlab.cpp.
