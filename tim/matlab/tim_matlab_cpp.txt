TIM Matlab C++ implementation
=============================

[[Parent]]: tim_matlab.txt

There can be only one entry point into a mex library.
This entry point is located at _tim_matlab.cpp_, in
the _mexFunction_ function. However, it is useful to 
pack multiple functions into a single mex library 
because otherwise much of the same binary code 
gets replicated into multiple mex libraries, resulting
in unnecessary large Matlab interfaces (in terms
of disk space). To achieve this, TIM Matlab exposes
to the Matlab side a single mex function called 
tim_matlab(). The first argument of this function 
specifies the name of the function that should be 
called inside the C++ implementation while the rest 
of the arguments are arguments for that function.

The TIM Matlab interface can be expanded easily by
implementing new C++ functions and registering them 
to be callable via tim_matlab. If you need to do
this, have a look at how the existing functions have
been implemented.

In Matlab, calling 

	tim_matlab('list');
	
lists all the registered functions.
