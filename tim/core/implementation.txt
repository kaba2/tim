Implementation
==============

The central abstractions in TIM Core are modeled by the classes
Signal and SignalPointSet. The Signal class models a time series
representing it as a matrix of values and allowing it to be
manipulated correspondingly. The SignalPointSet class in turn models a
reinterpretation of a time series as a semi-dynamic set of points.
