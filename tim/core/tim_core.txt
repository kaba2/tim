TIM Core
========

[[Parent]]: tim.txt

_TIM Core_ is the part of TIM which actually computes the estimates.
The central abstractions in TIM Core are modeled by the classes
`Signal` and `SignalPointSet`. The `Signal` class models a time series
representing it as a matrix of values and allowing it to be
manipulated correspondingly. The `SignalPointSet` class in turn models a
reinterpretation of a time series as a semi-dynamic set of points.
