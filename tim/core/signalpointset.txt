SignalPointSet class
====================

[Parent]: tim_cpp.txt

Theory
------

Let ''P'' be a point set in ''RR^n''. A _semi-dynamic point set_ ''S'' over ''P''
is a function ''S : ZZ -> 2^P''. ''S'' then represents a time-varying point set that
potentially changes at each discrete time instant by removing and inserting
points of ''P''.

Practice
--------

TIM implements the SignalPointSet class to model semi-dynamic point
sets. It takes in an ensemble of signals and interprets the realizations as
a semi-dynamic point set. It then builds an efficient data structure 
(multi-resolution kd-tree) which can be used to perform nearest neighbor
searching and counting for the points. This data structure can be 
accessed from the outside in a non-mutating manner.

The SignalPointSet restricts the definition of the semi-dynamic point set by
requiring that the points that are included in the set at a given time instant 
form an interval in the time-series. Thus SignalPointSet offers a time-windowed 
view to the point set, with the ability to set the position and extent of the time 
window arbitrarily.
