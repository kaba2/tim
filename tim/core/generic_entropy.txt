Generic entropy estimation
==========================

[[Parent]]: entropy.txt

The _generic entropy estimator_ refers to an algorithmic skeleton
which is used to compute the k-nearest-neighbor-based entropy estimators.
The main idea is that the algorithms for the estimation of Renyi entropy, 
Tsallis entropy, and Shannon differential entropy share a very similar 
estimation algorithm, with the differences being localized to a few key 
points. The generic entropy estimator encapsulates this similarity
and allows to customize these key points via _entropy algorithm_ objects.
