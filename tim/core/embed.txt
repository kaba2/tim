Delay embedding
===============

Theory
------

Let ''S : ZZ -> RR^n'' be an ''n''-dimensional signal.

### Delay-embedding

A _delay-embedding_ of ''S'' is a signal 
''R : ZZ -> RR^(kn)'' such that 

''R(t) = (
(S(t)), 
(S(t + Delta t)), 
(...), 
(S(t + (k - 1) Delta t)))''

where
 
 * ''Delta t in ZZ'' is the _embedding delay_.
 
 * ''k in ZZ'' is the _embedding factor_.
 
 * ''kn'' is the _embedding dimension_.
 
A specific delay-embedding can be identified with the 
pair ''(Delta t, k)''.

### Future of a signal

The _future_ of the signal ''S'' under a given 
delay-embedding ''(Delta t, k)'' is given by
the signal ''Q : ZZ -> RR^n'' such that

''Q(t) = S(t + k Delta t)''

Practice
--------

You might notice that we do not allow for embedding shift,
i.e. translation of the signal before delay-embedding.
This is deliberate, since this way the time instant zero
keeps associated to the first element of the embedded signal.
The time shifting is done in the estimators via the lag 
parameters.
