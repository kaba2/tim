Stowell-Plumbley estimator
==========================

[Parent]: differential_entropy.txt

The Stowell-Plumbley differential entropy estimator 
is a non-parametric estimator based on approximating 
the underlying probability density function by a cover 
of disjoint axis-aligned boxes with uniform densities.
The implementation of this estimator in TIM has an 
average runtime of O(n log(n) + n d), which is very
fast compared to the other estimators. Unfortunately,
it is not very accurate in higher dimensions,
and thus we do not recommend using it in dimensions 
higher than 3. For higher dimensions you should the
estimators based on nearest neighbors, such as
Kozachenko-Leonenko or Nilsson-Kleijn.
