Stowell-Plumbley estimator
==========================

[Parent]: differential_entropy.txt

The Stowell-Plumbley differential entropy estimator 
is a non-parametric estimator based on approximating 
the underlying probability density function by a cover 
of disjoint axis-aligned boxes with uniform densities.
The implementation of this estimator in TIM has an 
average runtime of ''O(m log(m) + m n)'', where
''m'' is the number of samples and ''n'' is the
dimension. This is very fast compared to the other 
estimators. Unfortunately, it is not very accurate 
in higher dimensions, and thus we do not recommend 
using it in dimensions higher than 3. For higher 
dimensions you should use the estimators based on nearest 
neighbors, such as Kozachenko-Leonenko or Nilsson-Kleijn.

Assumptions
-----------

 * The data must be full-dimensional. If this is not the
 case, you should use the Nilsson-Kleijn estimator instead.

 * For accuracy, there must be at least ''2^n'' samples, 
 where ''n'' is the dimension of the sample set.
 
 * For accuracy, the dimension of the sample set must not 
 be higher than 3.
