Kozachenko-Leonenko estimator
=============================

[Parent]: differential_entropy.txt

The Kozachenko-Leonenko differential estimator is
a non-parametric estimator based on k:th nearest 
neighbors of a sample set. 

Assumptions
-----------

 * Data must be full-dimensional, i.e. not concentrated
 on the surface of a lower-dimensional manifold. If this 
 is not the case, consider using the Nilsson-Kleijn
 estimator instead.

 * The probability density function of the underlying
 random variable must be differentiable. For example,
 uniform distribution in ''[0, 1]^n'' gives bad
 estimates.
