Let ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'', and ''w'' be random variables.
Partial transfer entropy is defined by:

''T(w, X, Y ; Z) = H(w X Z) + H(X, Z, Y) - H(X Z) - H(w X Z Y)''

where ''w'' is the future of ''X''. It measures the amount of directed
information flow from ''X'' to ''Y'' while discounting the possibility
that ''Z'' drives both ''X'' and ''Y''.
