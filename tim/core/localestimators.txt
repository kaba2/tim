Local estimators
================

[[Parent]]: entropy_combination.txt

The _local estimators_ are used to specify the local estimation 
procedure used in the generic entropy combination estimation
algorithm. When basing the estimation on k-nearest neighbors,
it is possible to estimate the probability mass in the k-nearest
neighbor ball by either the log-of-expectation or the 
expectation-of-log. In addition, in the marginal spaces one can 
opt for the same k-nearest-neighbor estimation again (which is 
based on slightly faulty assumptions) or use density estimation 
instead (which has better assumptions). Given the different choices, 
it is sensible to abstract out this local part of the estimation,
so that we can easily compare the resulting estimators.
