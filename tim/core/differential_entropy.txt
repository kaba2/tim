Shannon differential entropy
============================

[[Parent]]: entropy.txt

The _differential entropy_ of a continuous random variable ''X'' is defined by

''H(X) = -int_{RR^d} f(x) log(f(x)) dx,''

where ''f : RR^d -> RR'' is the probability density function of ''X''. 

Entropy vs differential entropy
-------------------------------

There is no generalization of Shannon entropy to continuous variables,
since differential entropy [is not an entropy combination][EntropyCombination].
Therefore, while the definition of differential entropy looks similar 
to the definition of discrete entropy, it does not generalize its 
properties. The role of differential entropy is two-fold. First, it is 
a syntactic device for describing other information theoretic 
concepts which are defined as combinations of differential 
entropies. Second, when transforming data to minimize mutual 
information, it is equivalent to minimize differential entropies, 
which can be a bit more efficient. This makes the estimation of
differential entropy by itself useful.

### Differential entropy on differentiable manifolds

The definition of differential entropy can be generalized by assuming that
''X'' is distributed on an ''m''-dimensional differentiable manifold ''M'' 
in ''RR^d'', ''0 <= m <= d'', with a probability density function ''f : M -> RR''.
Then differential entropy is defined by:

''H(X) = -int_{M} f(x) log(f(x)) dx''

TIM implements estimators for both of these definitions.
