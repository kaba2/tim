Differential entropy
====================

Theory

Assume that ''X'' is a random variable distributed according to the probability 
density function ''mu'' in some space ''V'' with a probability 
measure. Then differential entropy is defined by:

''H(X) = -int_V mu(x) log(mu(x)) dx''

While this formula looks similar to the definition of
discrete entropy, it does not generalize its properties.
The role of differential entropy is two-fold. First, it is
a syntactic device for describing other information theoretic 
concepts which are defined as combinations of differential 
entropies. Second, when transforming data to minimize mutual 
information, it is equivalent to minimize differential entropies, 
which can be a bit more efficient. This makes the estimation of
differential entropies by themself useful.
