Differential entropy

Assume that ''X'' is a random variable in ''RR^n'' distributed according to the probability 
density function ''mu : RR^n -> RR''. Then differential entropy is defined by:

''H(X) = -int_{RR^n} mu(x) log(mu(x)) dx''

While this formula looks similar to the definition of
discrete entropy, it does not generalize its properties.
The role of differential entropy is two-fold. First, it is
a syntactic device for describing other information theoretic 
concepts which are defined as combinations of differential 
entropies. Second, when transforming data to minimize mutual 
information, it is equivalent to minimize differential entropies, 
which can be a bit more efficient. This makes the estimation of
differential entropies by themself useful.

The definition of differential entropy can be generalized by assuming that
''X'' is distributed on a ''d''-dimensional differentiable manifold ''M'' 
in ''RR^n'', ''0 <= d <= n'', with a probability density function ''mu : M -> RR''.
Then differential entropy is defined by:

''H(X) = -int_{M} mu(x) log(mu(x)) dx''

TIM implements estimators for both of these definitions.
