Temporal estimation
===================

[[Parent]]: tim_core.txt

TIM allows to compute many of the measures using temporally 
adaptive estimators. This means that a time-window is used
to concentrate on a smaller piece of the time series at a
given time instant and no samples are used for the estimation 
beyond the window. 

### Temporal weighting functions

TIM allows the user to specify the weighting of the samples 
inside the time-window: for a given time instant it makes 
sense to give more weight to those samples near in time compared 
to those far away. Using a weighting function which is continuous 
and goes to zero at the window edges turns the temporal estimate 
into a continuous function of time.

There is only one requirement for a weighting function:
the weights inside the time-window must sum to a non-zero value.
This sum-value need not be 1, because TIM divides the weighting
values by the sum-value.

### Output of temporal entropy combination estimators

The temporal entropy combinations output an array of data,
where each element corresponds to an estimate at the given
time instant.
An important thing to know is that the size of the output
array is independent on the lags that are used. Rather,
the size is given by the minimum number of samples among the
used signals. To give time correspondence between the output
and the original signals, the output array is padded with
NaNs before and after the temporal estimates.
