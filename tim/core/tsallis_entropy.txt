Tsallis entropy
===============

[[Parent]]: entropy.txt

The _Tsallis entropy_ of a continuous random variable ''X'' is defined by

''H_q(X) = (1 / (q - 1))(1 - int_{RR^n} f^q(x) dx)''

where ''f : RR^n -> RR'' is the probability density function of ''X'',
and ''q in RR''. As ''q'' approaches 1, the Tsallis entropy approaches
the Shannon differential entropy. This limit can be made part of the
definition to make Tsallis entropy continuous on ''q''.
