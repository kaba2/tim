Practice
--------

TIM implements various estimators for differential entropy,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and a general class of entropy 
combinations. The latter class includes measures such as
mutual information and transfer entropy, in both partialized
and non-partialized forms. In addition, TIM can optionally carry 
out many of these estimations so that they are adaptive to time 
(via time-windowing). TIM can also efficiently take advantage
of data from multiple trials of the same experiment.
