Estimators

[[Parent]]: user_documentation.txt

This page introduces the estimators that have been implemented in TIM. TIM can optionally carry out many of these estimations so that they are adaptive in time (via time-windowing). TIM can also efficiently take advantage of data from multiple trials of the same experiment. Note that the estimators work with continuous variables. No support for discrete variables is available.
