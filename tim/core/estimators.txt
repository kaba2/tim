Estimators
==========

[[Parent]]: tim.txt

This page introduces the estimators that have been implemented in TIM.
TIM can optionally carry out many of these estimations so that they 
are adaptive to time (via time-windowing). TIM can also efficiently 
take advantage of data from multiple trials of the same experiment.
Note that the estimators work with continuous variables. No support
for discrete variables is available.
