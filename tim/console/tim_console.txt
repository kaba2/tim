TIM Console interface
=======================

[Parent]: tim.txt

The console interface is one of the three ways to access the 
functionality in TIM (the other two being Matlab and direct use). 
This interface offers a minimalistic programming language to 
specify data as well as to compute the needed estimates. The 
syntax of this language mimics that of Matlab.

Usage
-----

Pass in a script through standard input, get the output
from standard output. E.g. in Windows console:

	tim_console <input.txt >output.txt
	
Quick-start: Example script file
--------------------------------

	// This is row-comment.
	% This is a row-comment too.

	// Define a 3x3 real-array A.

	A = [     1.231, .324,        3.0;
			  -4.32,    5,        6.2;
		 -7.324e-12,   -8, +9.435E-12]
		 
	// Define an integer.
	
	k = 1
	
	// Define a real number.
	
	eps = 0.1
	     
	// Output the contents of A to standard output.
	
	print A

	// Define B as an alias to A.
	
	B = A
	
	// Define a 2x2 cell-array C.

	C = {A, B; 
		 B, A}
		 
	// Compute differential entropy and
	// print it to standard output.
	
	print differential_entropy_kl(C)
