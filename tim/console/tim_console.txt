TIM Console
===========

[[Parent]]: tim.txt

_TIM Console_ is one of the three ways to access the 
functionality in TIM. It is a simple command-line program that
interprets a script written in a minimalistic programming language 
to specify data as well as to compute the needed estimates. The 
syntax of this language mimics that of Matlab.

Usage
-----

 * Pass in a script through standard input and get the output
from standard output:

		tim_console <input.txt >output.txt

 * Or pass in a script through standard input and 
write the results to files (in the script).

		tim_console <input.txt

 * Or use both of these styles.

_Note: Running TIM Console and passing input row-by-row from 
keyboard does not work._

Quick-start: Example script file
--------------------------------

Here is an example script file in TIM Console:

	% This is a row-comment.
	// This is a row-comment too.

	% Define a 3x3 real-array A.
	A = [     1.231, .324,        3.0;
			  -4.32,    5,        6.2;
		 -7.324e-12,   -8, +9.435E-12]
		 
	% Define an integer.
	k = 1
	
	% Define a real number.
	eps = 0.1
	     
	% Output the contents of A to standard output.
	print A

	% Define B as an alias to A.
	B = A
	
	% Define a 2x2 cell-array C.
	C = {A, B; 
		 B, A}
		 
	% Compute differential entropy and
	% print it to standard output.
	print differential_entropy_kl(C)
