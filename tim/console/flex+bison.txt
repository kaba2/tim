Flex and Bison in Windows and Visual Studio
===========================================

The implementations of Flex and Bison contain some
bugs which are resolved here.

1. To some common include directory, add an empty file 'unistd.h'.
This gets rid of the missing include file error.

2. Use the following options in the lex file to get rid of linker errors 
under Windows:
%option never-interactive nounput
