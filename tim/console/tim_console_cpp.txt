TIM Console implementation
==========================

[[Parent]]: implementation.txt

This page contains the implementation of TIM Console. 
It is written purely in C++. The parser is generated using 
GNU Bison, and the lexical analyzer is generated using
GNU Flex. The main ideas are: parse the script file, build
an abstract syntax tree out of it, and interpret the
program from it.
