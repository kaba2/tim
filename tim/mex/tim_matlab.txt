TIM Matlab interface
====================

Functions
---------

TIM provides the following Matlab functions:

 * differential_entropy
 * differential_entropy_t
 * mutual_information
 * mutual_information_t
 * mutual_information_p
 * mutual_information_pt
 * transfer_entropy 
 * transfer_entropy_t
 * transfer_entropy_p
 * transfer_entropy_pt
 * entropy_combination
 * entropy_combination_t

Naming
------

The _t_ suffix stands for a temporal version, which
is adaptive to temporal changes in the estimated measure
via time-windowing. The _p_ suffix stands for a partialized
version (partial mutual information and partial transfer entropy). 
Because partialization and temporality are orthogonal 
concepts, there are also versions which have both. These are 
named with the _pt_ suffix.
If you do not need temporal results, then you should use
the non-temporal versions: they are more efficient
in their memory use when using multiple threads 
(however, their performance is similar).

Integrated help
---------------

You can find function-specific documentation by using 
Matlab's integrated help system. For example, for help on
using the differential_entropy function, enter 'help differential_entropy'
in Matlab.
