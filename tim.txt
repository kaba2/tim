The package contains 64-bit prebuilds for Windows and Linux. TIM can also be built under Mac OS X, but unfortunately I don't have access to such a machine.

__Note__: For Windows, you need to have the 
[Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019][VisualRedist] 
installed for the prebuilt TIM to work.

For previous versions, see the [release history][ReleaseHistory].
