Description
-----------

TIM is a C++ library for efficient estimation of information-theoretic measures
from continuous-valued time-series' in arbitrary dimensions. It has a Matlab interface 
as well as a console interface.

Features
--------

 * Estimation of Shannon differential entropy using various estimators.
 * Estimation of Renyi entropies.
 * Estimation of Tsallis entropies.
 * Estimation of a general class of entropy combinations including mutual information, 
partial mutual information, transfer entropy, and partial transfer entropy.
 * Estimation of Kullback-Leibler divergence.
 * Temporal estimation using time-windowing.
 * Estimation from an ensemble of time-series' representing trials of the same experiment.
 * Time-series' with arbitrary-dimensionality.
 * Multi-core parallel computation.
 * Three ways to use: as a C++ library, through TIM Matlab interface, or through TIM Console interface.

News
----

### 26.2.2010 - Released version 1.1.0

 * Added estimation of Renyi entropies.
 * Added estimation of Tsallis entropies.
 * Added delay embedding.
 * Improved the handling of degenerate cases.
 * TIM Matlab: Packed all functionality to a single mex 
 file instead of multiple ones.
 * TIM Matlab and TIM Console: Allowed multiple
 lags to be specified for estimators.
 * Made the output of temporal estimators to have a 
 width independent of lags (padded with NaNs).
 * Removed the parameter to specify maximum relative 
 error in nearest neighbors searching because of too 
 large errors in entropy estimators to be of use.

Software
--------

Here we provide prebuilt binaries for Windows users. Note that you may need to
install the Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package if your computer does
not have them installed already.

Source-code
-----------

The source-code for TIM is licensed under the _GNU Lesser GPL_ license, which is 
unrestrictive and non-viral. It should be emphasized that the intent of publishing 
the source-code for TIM is purely for educational/research purposes, rather than for 
actually building software that depends on it. This is because we can't guarantee stable 
interfaces, i.e., we continue development of TIM and in this process can make 
breaking changes to interfaces.

TIM is built on the [Pastel][] library which must also be 
installed if you want to build TIM yourself. It also uses some features
of the [Boost][] library.

On these documentation pages we provide an easy way to browse the source-code 
complete with coloring and linking. You might find this a more convenient alternative
when familiarizing yourself with the source-code, compared to downloading and viewing 
the raw source-code.

Note on web-browsers
--------------------

This documentation uses MathML to display inlined mathematics.
Unfortunately not all browsers support MathML natively, including
Internet Explorer. In this case you will not be able to see the 
mathematical expressions correctly. While there is a plug-in 
available (MathPlayer) for adding this capability to Internet Explorer, 
in our tests this combination crashed the browser when viewing 
these pages. According to Wikipedia, some major web-browsers that 
currently display MathML natively include Mozilla Firefox, Opera, 
and Camino. At this point we can't do anything else than to direct 
you to use these browsers to view these pages.

The development of TIM has been financially supported 
by the EU project _GABA_ (FP6-2005-NEST-Path 043309).

TIM Console interface was programmed under funding from the 
[Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion][TES]

[German Gomez-Herrero][German] provided substantial amount of beta testing, feedback, 
and guidance during the development. He is also the driving force behind the 
idea of creating TIM, having created a similar library in Matlab himself.
