_TIM_ is a cross-platform C++ library for efficient estimation of 
information-theoretic measures from continuous-valued time-series' 
in arbitrary dimensions. It has a Matlab interface as well as a 
console interface.

Features
--------

 * Estimation of [Shannon differential entropy][Shannon] 
 using various estimators.
 * Estimation of [Renyi entropies][Renyi].
 * Estimation of [Tsallis entropies][Tsallis].
 * Estimation of [entropy combinations][Combinations] including mutual 
 information, partial mutual information, transfer entropy, and partial 
 transfer entropy.
 * Estimation of [Kullback-Leibler divergence][Divergence].
 * [Temporal estimation][Temporal] using time-windowing.
 * Estimation from an ensemble of time-series' representing trials of 
 the same experiment.
 * Time-series' with arbitrary-dimensionality.
 * Multi-core parallel computation.
 * Three ways to use: as a C++ library, through TIM Matlab interface, or 
 through TIM Console interface.

Note: Since the newest Matlab version 2010b only supports gcc 4.0 
under Mac OS X, and the OpenMP support requires at least gcc 4.2,
it is not currently possible to build Matlab components with OpenMP
enabled under Mac OS X. This means a significant loss of performance
for multi-core computers.

Source-code
-----------

The source-code for TIM is licensed under the _GNU Lesser GPL_ license, which is 
unrestrictive and non-viral. It should be emphasized that the intent of publishing 
the source-code for TIM is purely for educational/research purposes, rather than for 
actually building software that depends on it. This is because we can't guarantee stable 
interfaces, i.e., we continue development of TIM and in this process can make 
breaking changes to interfaces.

Note on web-browsers
--------------------

This documentation uses MathML to display inlined mathematics.
Unfortunately not all browsers support MathML natively, including
Internet Explorer. In this case you will not be able to see the 
mathematical expressions correctly. While there is a plug-in 
available (MathPlayer) for adding this capability to Internet Explorer, 
in our tests this combination crashed the browser when viewing 
these pages. According to Wikipedia, some major web-browsers that 
currently display MathML natively include Mozilla Firefox, Opera, 
and Camino. At this point we can't do anything else than to direct 
you to use these browsers to view these pages.

The version 1.0 of TIM was programmed under funding from the EU project 
[GABA][GABA] (FP6-2005-NEST-Path 043309). TIM Console and most of the update 
from version 1.0 to 1.1 were programmed under funding from the 
[Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion][TES].

[German Gomez Herrero][German] is the driving force behind the idea of 
creating TIM, having created a similar library in Matlab himself. German
provided substantial amount of testing, feedback, and guidance 
during the development. He has also written the tutorials in this
documentation.
