TIM

_TIM_ is a cross-platform open-source C++ library for efficient 
estimation of information-theoretic measures from continuous-valued 
time-series' in arbitrary dimensions. It has a Matlab interface as 
well as a console interface.

Please use the link <http://www.tut.fi/tim> to refer to this page,
for redirection to the latest version.

__Important__: The version 1.1.0, released 17.3.2011, included a critical bug
which made TIM give completely erroneous results for multi-trial estimates.
Please replace that version with the current version. Apologies for any 
problems this has caused.

Features
--------

 * Estimation of [Shannon differential entropy][Shannon] 
 using various estimators.
 * Estimation of [Renyi entropies][Renyi].
 * Estimation of [Tsallis entropies][Tsallis].
 * Estimation of [entropy combinations][Combinations] including mutual 
 information, partial mutual information, transfer entropy, and partial 
 transfer entropy.
 * Estimation of [Kullback-Leibler divergence][Divergence].
 * [Temporal estimation][Temporal] using time-windowing.
 * Estimation from an ensemble of time-series' representing trials of 
 the same experiment.
 * Time-series' with arbitrary-dimensionality.
 * Multi-core parallel computation.
 * Three ways to use: as a C++ library, through TIM Matlab interface, or 
 through TIM Console interface.

Download
--------

Here you can download the latest version of TIM prebuilt
for various platforms. The prebuilds have been done for 
Windows and Linux, in both 32-bit and 64-bit modes. 
For easy transition between platforms, we have packed
all of these builds in the same package. To obtain previous 
versions, see the [release history][ReleaseHistory].

[Download TIM Console 1.2.0][TIM-Console]

__Note__: For Windows, you need to have the 
[Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package][VisualRedist] 
installed for the prebuilt TIM to work.

__Note__: Mac OS X builds are not provided for now, because we
do not have a convenient access to such machine. However, it is
possible to build TIM for Mac OS X (although OpenMP can not be 
supported).

Source-code
-----------

The source-code for TIM is licensed under the _GNU Lesser GPL_ license, which is 
unrestrictive and non-viral. It should be emphasized that the intent of publishing 
the source-code for TIM is purely for educational/research purposes, rather than for 
actually building software that depends on it. This is because we can't guarantee stable 
interfaces, i.e., we continue development of TIM and in this process can make 
breaking changes to interfaces.

Support
-------

We offer several ways to keep in touch with the development of TIM.
Most of these features are available through the 
[TIM development pages in Sourceforge][TIM-dev]. 
From there, you can

 * Report bugs.
 * Suggest new features.
 * Ask for general help in a forum.
 * Join mailing lists (for news etc).

We encourage you to use these ways of interaction, rather than 
private e-mails, because this way the discussions benefit other
people too.

Note on web-browsers
--------------------

This documentation uses MathML to display inlined mathematics.
Unfortunately not all browsers support MathML natively, including
Internet Explorer. In this case you will not be able to see the 
mathematical expressions correctly. While there is a plug-in 
available (MathPlayer) for adding this capability to Internet Explorer, 
in our tests this combination crashed the browser when viewing 
these pages. According to Wikipedia, some major web-browsers that 
currently display MathML natively include Mozilla Firefox, Opera, 
and Camino. At this point we can't do anything else than to direct 
you to use these browsers to view these pages.

The version 1.0 of TIM was programmed under funding from the EU project 
[GABA][GABA] (FP6-2005-NEST-Path 043309). TIM Console and most of the update 
from version 1.0 to 1.1 were programmed under funding from the 
[Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion][TES].

[German Gomez Herrero][German] is the driving force behind the idea of 
creating TIM, having created a similar library in Matlab himself. German
provided substantial amount of testing, feedback, and guidance 
during the development. He has also written the tutorials in this
documentation.
