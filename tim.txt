Description
-----------

TIM is a C++ library for efficient estimation of information-theoretic measures
from time-series' in arbitrary dimensions. It also has a Matlab interface.

Features
--------

* Estimation of differential entropy using various estimators
* Estimation of a general class of entropy combinations including mutual information, 
partial mutual information, transfer entropy, and partial transfer entropy
* Temporal estimation using time windowing
* Estimation from an ensemble of time-series' representing trials of the same experiment
* Time-series' with arbitrary dimensionality
* Multi-core parallel computation
* Both C++ and Matlab interfaces

Software
--------

TIM can be used in either of two ways. The first one is to use it
via the provided Matlab interface with precompiled binaries. 
The second one is to build your own C++ software using it. This option
is discussed in more detail below.

Source-code
-----------

The source-code for TIM is licensed under the _GNU Lesser GPL_ license, which is 
unrestrictive and non-viral. We provide two easy ways to browse the source-code
online complete with coloring. The first one is to read this documentation, 
following the _Learn more_ links. The second one is to view the 
source-code tree.

Note that TIM is built on the [Pastel][] library which must also be 
installed if you want to build TIM yourself. It also uses some features
of the [Boost][] library.

It should be emphasized that the intent of publishing the source-code for TIM
is purely for educational/research purposes, rather than for actually building
software that depends on it. This is because we can't guarantee stable 
interfaces, i.e., we continue development of both TIM and Pastel and in this 
process can make breaking changes to interfaces.
