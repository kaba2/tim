Release history
===============

[[Parent]]: tim.txt

The versioning of TIM is given in the form x.y.z, where x, y, and z are integers. 
The x increments only for major changes, the y increments for feature changes, and 
the z increments for bug fixes or documentation updates. Whenever y is incremented,
z is zeroed, and whenever x is incremented, both y and z are zeroed. The x, y, and z
need not consist of a single digit, and, for example, 1.12.0 is a much later version than 1.1.3.

[Download TIM Source 1.1.0][TIM-Source-1.1.0]

[TIM-Source-1.1.0]: ./files/tim-1.1.0.zip

Release date xx.xx.2010.

#### TIM Core

 * Added estimation of Renyi entropies.
 * Added estimation of Tsallis entropies.
 * Improved the handling of degenerate cases.
 * Improved the performance of range counting used
 in entropy combination estimators.
 * Made the output of temporal estimators to have a 
 width independent of lags (padded with NaNs) and the
 first element to correspond to time instant 0.
 * Generalized temporal estimation such that the
 contributions of the estimates can be weighted with 
 respect to the distance in time.
 * Fixed a bug when computing entropy combinations
 with signals of unequal length.

#### TIM Matlab

 * Real arrays are now interpreted as cell-arrays 
 containing a single trial in the estimators.
 * Allowed multiple lags to be specified for 
 entropy combination estimators.
 * Added trial permutation and permutation test.
 * Packed all functionality to a single mex 
 file instead of multiple ones.
 
#### TIM Console

 * Added support for Not-A-Number (NaN) and 
 infinity (Inf) real values.
 * Fixed a bug which caused manually specified
 real-arrays to be rounded to integer values.

#### TIM Matlab and TIM Console

 * Added delay-embedding.
 * Added support for generalized versions
 of temporal estimators.
 
#### Breaking changes

 * Removed the parameter to specify maximum relative 
 error in nearest neighbors searching because of too 
 large errors in entropy estimators to be of use. You
 will need to remove this argument from calls to
 `differential_entropy_kl` and `differential_entropy_kl_t`.
 * The now-introduced padded NaNs in temporal estimates 
 might make your current subsequent computations fail. 
 * In TIM Matlab, the new `filter` parameter has been
 inserted before the `threads`. If you used the `threads`
 parameter, you will need the add the `filter` argument
 before it.

 * Source built over [Pastel][] 1.2. 
 * Documentation built over [Remark][] 1.2.
