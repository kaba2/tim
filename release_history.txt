Release history
===============

[[Parent]]: tim.txt

The versioning of TIM is given in the form x.y.z, where x, y, and z 
are integers. The x increments only for major changes, the y increments 
for feature changes, and the z increments for bug fixes or documentation 
updates. Whenever y is incremented, z is zeroed, and whenever x is 
incremented, both y and z are zeroed. The x, y, and z need not consist 
of a single digit, and, for example, 1.12.0 is a much later version 
than 1.1.3.

[Download TIM Source 1.1.0 beta][TIM-Source-1.1.0-beta]

[TIM-Source-1.1.0-beta]: ./files/tim-1.1.0-beta.zip

Release date xx.3.2011.

#### TIM Core

 * Added estimation of Renyi entropies.
 * Added estimation of Tsallis entropies.
 * Improved the handling of degenerate cases.
 * Improved the performance of range counting used
 in entropy combination estimators.
 * Improved the performance of temporal estimators
 by using hiding and showing in the kd-tree.
 * Made the output of temporal estimators to have a 
 width independent of lags (padded with NaNs) and the
 first element to correspond to time instant 0.
 * Generalized temporal estimation such that the
 contributions of the estimates can be weighted with 
 respect to the distance in time.
 * Fixed a bug when computing entropy combinations
 with signals of unequal length.

#### TIM Matlab

 * Real arrays are now interpreted as cell-arrays 
 containing a single trial in the estimators.
 * Allowed multiple lags to be specified for 
 entropy combination estimators.
 * Added trial permutation and permutation test.
 * Packed all functionality into a single mex 
 file instead of multiple ones.
 * Improved robustness by using the PastelMatlab
 library.
 
#### TIM Console

 * Added support for Not-A-Number (NaN) and 
 infinity (Inf) real values.
 * Fixed a bug which caused manually specified
 real-arrays to be rounded to integer values.

#### TIM Matlab and TIM Console

 * Added delay-embedding.
 * Added support for generalized versions
 of temporal estimators.
 
#### Breaking changes in TIM Matlab

 * Removed the parameter to specify maximum relative 
 error in nearest neighbors searching because of too 
 large errors in entropy estimators to be of use. You
 will need to remove this argument from calls to
 `differential_entropy_kl` and `differential_entropy_kl_t`.
 * The now-introduced padded NaNs in temporal estimates 
 might make your current subsequent computations fail. 
 * The 'threads' parameter has been removed.
 * A new `filter` parameter has been inserted in temporal 
 estimators. This can accidentally get mixed with 'threads' 
 parameter of the previous version.

#### Other stuff

 * Added a new tutorial: _Coping with unknown coupling delays_.
 * Source built over [Pastel][] 1.2. 
 * Documentation built over [Remark][] 1.2.
