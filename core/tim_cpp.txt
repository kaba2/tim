TIM C++ implementation

Theory
------

The central abstractions in TIM are modeled by the classes
Signal and SignalPointSet. The Signal class models a time series
representing it as a matrix of values and allowing it to be
manipulated correspondingly. The SignalPointSet class in turn models a
reinterpretation of a time series as a semidynamic set of points.

Iterators and iterator ranges
-----------------------------

TIM uses iterator ranges to abstract away the differences
between different kinds of containers, as well as to make up for
an efficient implementation. An iterator range is essentially
a triple (b, e, d) where b and e form an iterator range [b, e[ and
where the distance between e and b is d. Apart from making the interface
of functions compact, iterator ranges also offer a form of concept-based 
overloading, compared to non-restricted templates when using only iterators.

Whenever a template function parametrizes an iterator range, the types
of the iterators are named in the form DereferencedType_Iterator. 
Examples include SignalPtr_Iterator and Real_Iterator. This documents
the requirement of the former to dereference to a SignalPtr and the latter
to dereference to a real.

Iterator ranges do not always make sense for output. For example,
if the output of the function is varying in number of writes, then
no fixed size iterator range does. Therefore, outputs are always specified
with a single output iterator. Whenever a template function parametrizes an 
output iterator, the type is named in the form DereferencedType_OutputIterator.
An example is given by Real_OutputIterator, which documents the requirement
of the iterator to dereference to a real.
