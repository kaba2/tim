TIM
===

Description
-----------

TIM is a C++ library for efficient estimation of information theoretic measures
from time series in arbitrary dimensions. It also has a Matlab interface.

Features
--------

* Non-parametric estimation based on k:th nearest neighbors
* Estimation of differential entropy
* Estimation of a general class of entropy combinations including mutual information, 
partial mutual information, transfer entropy, and multivariate transfer entropy
* Temporal estimation using time windowing
* Estimation from an ensemble of time series representing trials of the same experiment
* Time series with arbitrary dimensionality
* Multi-core parallel computation
* Both C++ and Matlab interfaces

Source code
-----------

The source code for TIM is licensed under the GNU Lesser GPL license, which is 
unrestrictive and non-viral. We provide two easy ways to browse the source code
online complete with coloring. The first one is to read this documentation, 
which is integrated with the source code. The second one is to view the 
source code tree. You can also download the source code.

Note that TIM is built on the [Pastel][Pastel] library which must also be 
installed if you want to build TIM yourself.
