Building the TIM library
========================

[[Parent]]: tim.txt

This page describes how to build the TIM library. This is only
necessary if prebuilt binaries are not available for your platform 
at the [main page][Main].
TIM uses the [Premake][Premake] build-script generator to turn
cross-platform building into a trivial task. Premake is a program, 
contained in a single executable, which reads in a generic 
build-script and outputs a tool-specific build-script. 
The TIM Matlab library needs to be [separately built][Matlab],
but to be able to do that you need to first build TIM Core.

[Matlab]: [[Ref]]: building_matlab.txt

__Note__: While the source code contains Visual Studio specific 
build files, you should ignore them, and follow the build process 
described here.

Build process
-------------

The steps to build TIM are as follows:

### 1. Install external libraries

See the [dependencies][Dependencies] page.

[Dependencies]: [[Ref]]: dependencies.txt
 
### 2. Install Premake

Premake can be downloaded from [here][DownloadPremake]. You might want 
to make it so that it can be invoked from any location, or alternatively 
just copy it to the TIM root directory.

### 3. Set the external library directories

In the TIM root directory, open the file `premake4.lua`, and modify
the directories to correspond to the locations you installed the 
external libraries in step 1.

	-- The directory of the Boost library's source code.
	-- The includes are of the form 'boost/static_assert.hpp'.
	boostIncludeDir = "../boost_1_45_0"

	-- The directory of the SDL library's header files.
	-- The includes are of the form 'SDL.h'.
	sdlIncludeDir = "../SDL-1.2.14/include"
	sdlLibraryDir = "../SDL-1.2.14/lib"

	-- The directory of the Pastel library's source code.
	-- The includes are of the form 'pastel/sys/array.h'
	pastelIncludeDir = "../pastel"
	pastelLibraryDir = "../pastel/lib"

### 4. Generate tool-specific build-scripts using Premake. 

In the TIM root directory, type

	premake4 action

where `action` describes the tool-set you want to generate
the build-scripts for (Visual Studio, gcc and makefiles, etc.). 
To see the supported tool-sets, type

	premake4 --help

### 5. Choose configuration and build
	
Go to the generated directory `build/action/`, where `action`
is the tool-set you chose in step 4, choose the desired configuration,
and start the build.

Configurations
--------------

TIM comes with four different build configurations. These are:

 * debug
 * develop
 * release
 * release-without-openmp

The `debug` configuration enables debugging information and turns on all
ASSERTs and PENSUREs. All other configurations 
disable debugging information. The `develop` version retains `ASSERT`s and 
`PENSURE`s, while `release` and `release-without-openmp` removes them. The 
`release-without-openmp` configuration is otherwise equivalent to `release` 
configuration, but disables OpenMP (e.g. when your tool-set does not
support it, as is the case with Express versions of Visual Studio).

Building
--------

When Premake has generated you the build-scripts, you probably already
know how to proceed. However, here are some specific examples:

### Visual Studio

To build TIM using Visual Studio:

 * Open the solution file `Tim.sln`. 
 * Right click on the solution in Solution Explorer, and choose 
 Configuration Manager. 
 * Select the desired Active Solution Configuration.
 * Build solution.

### Makefiles

To build TIM using makefiles, type 
	
	make config=configuration

Where `configuration` is one of the configurations listed in the
previous section. To obtain further information, type 

	make help 

Output files
------------

The libraries and executables will be written to the `lib/`
sub-directory of the `build/action/` directory. The intermediate
files, such as object files, will be written to the `obj/`
sub-directory of the `build/action` directory.
The `debug` versions will be suffixed with `_d`, while the
`develop` versions will be suffixed with `_v`.
