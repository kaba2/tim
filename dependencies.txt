Dependencies
============

[[Parent]]: tim.txt

TIM uses a few external libraries which must be installed in order 
to compile and link TIM succesfully. These libraries are listed here.
The version number that follows the library name is the one that the
current version of TIM was used to develop against. This is useful to 
know in case a later version breaks backward compatibility.
